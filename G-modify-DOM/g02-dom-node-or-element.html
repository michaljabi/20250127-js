        // To do so, you need to uncomment line below

        // You can also do it that way (if you want to add multiple Elements as next arguments)

        // From now on, when element is on the DOM it will become a part of the DOM Node Tree.

         * 1. Confirm that one Element instance can be only once on the DOM tree
         * 2. If you try to add it multiple times it will still be present only once
         * 3. .... how do you think - Why?
         *
         * 4. What to do to make <h1>Hello Text</h1> appear twice on the DOM tree (using JavaScript)
