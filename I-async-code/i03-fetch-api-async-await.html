      * More real life use case of using Promises and async / await
      *
      * Is when you resolve some asynchronous operation - like ask server for data.
      * That could go well - or fail because of few reasons (like e.g.: sever not available)
      *
      * Notice we use type="module" here to have so called "top level await"
