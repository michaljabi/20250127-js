      // you can have more than one script on the website.
      // IF the scripts aren't --> type="module" (!) They will share same scope !!!

      // for example, I can access a const:
      console.log(testMe);

      // However - this is not a "good feature" when comes to write complex JavaScript code.
      // This is because, we might not know about existence of some identifiers, and make errors like this:

      // If you uncomment line below it will cause an error (!)
      // const testMe = 'Hello !'
      // SyntaxError: Identifier 'testMe' has already been declared

      /**
            #TASK f03:
            1. make sure line 28 is commented out (no errors on website)
            2. implement event that will fire on mouse over for <strong>2024/06/10</strong>
            3. it should alert() about the order name (2024/06/10)
