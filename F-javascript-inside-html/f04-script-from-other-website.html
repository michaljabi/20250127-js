      // Now we can access here a things form same scope as UmbrellaJS
      // https://umbrellajs.com/
      // UmbrellaJS is a lib similar to jQuery or zepto.js

      // After that line 12 been placed, you can access global u object for example:
      console.log(u);

      // This "u" is defined in scope of umbrella, that is why we can use it:
      u('h1').text('Hello from UmbrellaJS')

      // Notice that this is `u` - because creator of that lib - made a variable named u
      // Because it is on the top of <script>, it will be accessed from other scripts.
