    <h4>List of my favourite fruits</h4>
    <ul data-list>

    </ul>
    <!--

        #f09 Task:

        - make 2 files: `main.js` and `fruits.js`

        - in `fruits.js`
            - just prepare an array of strings - your favourite (at least 4) fruits
            - export it

        - in `main.js`:
            - make logic to import data form `fruits.js` and show them on <ul> element
            - you can use, template string:
                `<li>${fruitName}</li>`
            - and loop over the fruit list.
            - finally add them as "ul[data-list]" element .innerHTML - to pretty print as bullet list

            - include src=`./main.js` here as a script - it should be type="module" !
