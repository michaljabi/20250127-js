      * JavaScript allows you to connect with back-end service of other website.
      *
      * This is called: AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
      * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AJAX
      *
      * Modern Ajax request can be made by fetch API, resolved as a Promise.
      * */

      // Let see an example:

      fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
              .then(response => response.json())
              .then(object => {
                // Here we will print one TODO from the list:
                console.log(object)
                // This is an JS object - ready to work with:
                console.log('title:', object.title, '| userId:', object.userId)
              })

      // open this address directly inside the browser:
      // https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
      // Over there you will have JSON object (string).

      // In our example in lines 22-27 "object" is a JavaScript Object already unwrapped from JSON string.
      // That way by .then().then() -> sequence of so called Promises (part I in async code will show you more about this) you can download code from back-end and use it as a DATA FEED to your APP!
